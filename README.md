# autoNurseRoster

Automatic nurse rostering system 

Designed a model to automate the nurse scheduling problem (hospital that requires a timetable specifying the work shifts for nurses over a specified period of time) 
Formulated the given problem into CSP and implemented a model for automatically generating rosters, meeting the given requirements of hospital and preferences of nurses, using constraint-satisfaction techniques.
Additionally, extended the above model to facilitate the meeting of soft constraint like preference of nurses.
